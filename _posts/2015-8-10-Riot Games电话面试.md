Riot Game这次电话面试机会是一顿饭局上骗来的，而且是我工作比较忙的时候做的，当时并没对美国的

### 1，Why you interested in this job?

As a deep player in LOL, I think it’s a great attraction to me to work in a company like Riot Games which derive from my own interest in the game. This is the first reason drives me to this job. Then I have been working in development of large online severs for a while so my main point in Riot Games will also be the development work in online game sever. I think I can offer my effort to help. As I was told before, when Riot Games built at the first place, we didn’t expect that League of Legands can have 27 million customers, so the whole architecture is facing a problem to contain and handler such a great amount of players smoothly in the same time. So to me it will be an interesting and challenging jobe to do with. At last, as the demand on the front page of Riot Games Career, I think myself will meet these requirements well which means I want to prove myself as a humble but ambitious, razor-sharp professional engineer in the Riot world.



### 2，Read the company value in the website?

Yes, the most impressive thing to me is Riot Games is a company which emphasizes the company culture and customer experience most. Riot Games impressed me that they want some guy who don’t obey the regular regulations all the time. The creative and imagination are very important to work here. Then I realized that it’s also very important that a employee in Riot Games should also be a player in League of Legends. It should not be just a game or project to someone working on it. Being a player of it is a principle to devote oneself into it and make more contributions on it. It will lead an engineer to know more about not only the game but also the need of a player. 

### 3,  Ideal company to work in

With special company culture, devote oneself into the product which is used and loved by its employee, focus on the experience of customers, never follow an old regulation, has keen technology, keeps learning new staff and ambition to do something amazing.  

### 4,  Five years future
……

### 5，Compare yourself to your friends in China

Communication, think pattern, culture mixed, teamwork

### 6，What they can improve

As League of Legends is more than a network computer game, but more like an athletic. But as an athletic, the match itself is just one aspect of it. Behind the match, there must be some aspects else to support it, like practice, video replay, and more detailed data analysis. 

Video replay system. Not only the data and graph, there must be some place to record, store and replay some specific match I’ve played. It can help player to analysis his behavior, the judgement of the whole situation to improve the performance of a player. Besides, the in-game or first-vision video from a better player can be a tutorial to some beginners. Also, a brilliant match video of mine can be shared on the social network which helps to spread the influence of the game, attracts more and more interest from others.
